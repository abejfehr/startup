## The CEO

The player is the CEO of your startup, and this game follows their story.

The CEO once worked at IBN as a developer, and decided one day to get his web buddy to build him a simple website. He doesn't know what he wants to do with his website, but he gets one anyways. He learns HTML4 from HTML for Dummies.

One day, the CEO quits his job at IBN, because he's looking for his purpose in life. Your old boss plays an integral role in the story of your startup, and he's a recurring character. Eventually, your old boss becomes an employee at your startup.
