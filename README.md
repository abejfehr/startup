# [Startup](https://www.abefehr.com/startup/)

A very refreshing game.

## Testing

Tests are written in Mocha and are found in the test directory. Tests can be run by running `gulp test`.

## Building

Make sure that you have all of the node modules installed first. This can be done by running `yarn install` first.

Just run `npm start`, and then navigate in your browser to http://localhost:8000/.
