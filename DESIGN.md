The game begins by showing only one line of text on the screen.

> This page has been viewed 1 time.

Out of curiousity, and to see if the view counter is correct, the user then refreshes the page and, to their surprise, the view count should go up by 1 each time. They'll do that for 5 views or so and then a table will appear showing them the workers they have.
